<h1>Pulo do Lobo</h1>

<p>The challenge on this project was to create a site for a product that could be bought online. That's where the Pulo do Lobo started.</p>
<p>Pulo do Lobo is an hipotetic olive oil brand from alentejo, which tells a story of a wolf and a waterfall and also how this waterfall allowed the production of a high quality olive oil.</p>
<p>For this the illustrations and also the design focus on telling a story from the product and the place from where it provains. Therefore, all the colors and contrasts where choosen in order to recall the portuguese olives.</p>
<p>The site was prototyiped in order to provide a simple user experience to the costumer, so he/she could get the best olive oil in an easy and online method.</p>
