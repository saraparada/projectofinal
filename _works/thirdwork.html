<h1>Bolsa de Emprego</h1>

<p>This project consisted on approaching, in a better way, the filters and atributtes of the site from Imovirtual.</p>
<p>For this challenge it was developed an interactive platform between real estate sellers and buyers in order not only to optimize the user experience but also to increase the convertion rate.</p>
<p>The platform consists on a high customization and personalized offer list that happens inside of the Imovirtual site without a need to contact a seller outside Imovirtual.</p>
