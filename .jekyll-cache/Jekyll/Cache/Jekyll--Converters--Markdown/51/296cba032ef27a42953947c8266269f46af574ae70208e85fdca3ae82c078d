<h1>American Utopia</h1>

<p>This project pays attention to an essay about the movie Easy Rider. Taking American conduct and ambition as a practical case, it is noticeable that this same American ‘’stereotype’’ is, in its resolution, pragmatically fictional.</p>
<p>In American Utopia the fiction of the movie is deconstructed, revealing just how unsustainable the american conduct is when we confronted by freedom, pride, prejudice and exception to this freedom from the same conduct</p>
<p>The selected geographical images contrast the width of America and its emptiness, propitious to creating a very structured and apparently solid conduct. On the other hand, the images of American ‘’emptiness’’ propose an allegory of space as a blank canvas for a construction of individual freedom.</p>
