<h1>Bolsa de emprego â€” FBAUL</h1>

<p>Having as a segment the alumni of the University of Fine Arts of Lisbon, the greatest needs and weaknesses have been analysed after the end of the course of the college.</p>
<p>With that said, it was inferred that one of the biggest pain points of this phase is precisely entering the working/professional world. As such, the faculty website job exchange was restructured to respond to this need and at the same time to encourage teachers to assist on job offers</p>
