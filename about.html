<h1>About</h1>

<p>My name is Sara Parada and I’m a Communication Designer. I choose to graduade in Design de Comunicação at Faculdade de Belas Artes in Lisboa because of my personal interest on approach communication based on a consistent design thinking and visual languages. This journey in the field brought me to use such particularities in order to develop self-promotion, divulgation and information control, in a efficient and optimized way.</p>

<p>On the other hand, communication design lead me to recognize digital media as a potencial place to invest in new communication processes, which made me acquire more knowledge on a DXD post graduation so I could learn more about the user experience and user interfaces.</p>

<p>Therefore, through out my formation I’ve managed some soft skills as project methodology, creativity, self-learning competences and problem solving capacity that are inherent to the role. So I believe that, most of all, my work could be qualify as flexible, attentive to details and good at communication, both individually and in teamwork.</p>
